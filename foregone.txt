PROBLEM STATEMENT

A particular keyboard is used to write cheques for the winners of a coding competition.
But, the keyboard is missing the number '4', so any amount containing the number '4' cannot be written.
The program written is supposed to split the amount into two parts where M and N where neither N nor M
can contain the digit '4' anywhere in it.
