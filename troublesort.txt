The basic operation of the standard bubble sort algorithm is to examine a pair of adjacent numbers, 
and reverse that pair if the left number is larger than the right number. 
But our algorithm examines a group of three adjacent numbers, and if the leftmost number is larger 
than the rightmost number, it reverses that entire group. 
Because our algorithm is a "triplet bubble sort", we have named it Trouble Sort for short.
